"""TransformerLens quarantine smoke test (REQ_112).

Asserts that TransformerLens imports outside the canonical-name surface
(``architectures/hooked_transformer.py`` and ``architectures/hooks.py``,
which aliases ``HookPoint``) do not grow beyond a known allow-list.

The allow-list is the set of files that imported TransformerLens
**before** REQ_112 landed. Each entry is scope owned by REQ_114 (analyzer
migration) or REQ_113 (MLP families). When those REQs migrate a file
off TransformerLens, its entry is removed from this list.

The strict version of this test (zero entries in the allow-list, hits
only in ``hooked_transformer.py``) becomes load-bearing under REQ_114.
For REQ_112, we enforce *no growth* — adding a TL import to a
not-allowed file is a regression.
