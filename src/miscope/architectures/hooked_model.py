"""HookedModel — the architecture-agnostic base class.

``HookedModel`` is the boundary between experiment-side knowledge
(training, variants, families, tasks) and analysis-side knowledge
(canonical hook names + tensors). Concrete architecture subclasses
(``HookedTransformer``, ``HookedOneHotMLP``, ``HookedEmbeddingMLP`` —
landing under REQ_112 / REQ_113) implement ``setup_hooks()``,
``forward()``, ``weight_names()``, and ``get_weight()``. Analyzers
receive a ``HookedModel`` and an :class:`ActivationCache`; they read by
canonical name and never import a concrete subclass type.

Subclass contract
-----------------
Subclasses must:

1. Build their submodules in ``__init__``.
2. Call ``self.setup_hooks()`` at the **end** of ``__init__`` — after all
   submodules are constructed. This ordering is the subclass's
   responsibility; the base class does not auto-invoke ``setup_hooks()``
   because that would run before the subclass has finished building.
3. Override ``forward(inputs) -> Tensor`` (the standard ``nn.Module``
   contract). The forward method must route activations through
   ``self.hook_points[canonical_name]`` at every capture point so the
   default ``run_with_cache`` implementation can collect them.
4. Override ``weight_names()`` and ``get_weight(name)`` to publish
   learned parameters under canonical paths.
5. Override ``setup_hooks()`` to populate ``self.hook_points`` with the
   canonical-name → ``HookPoint`` mapping. Each ``HookPoint`` must be
   registered as a child module so PyTorch's hook machinery can find it
   (the helper ``_register_hook_point`` does both at once).

This module has no imports from the underlying TransformerLens
library. The grep quarantine test (REQ_112) depends on this.
