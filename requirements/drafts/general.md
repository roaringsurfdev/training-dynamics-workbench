REQ_???
Priority: LOW. This is a requirement that I am trying to keep in mind as the project grows. I want to make sure we don't implement anything that makes it too costly to implement parallelization down the road.

Parallelize analysis. Allow the analysis engine to process multiple epochs at a time. Not sure how planning GPU usage works here.
