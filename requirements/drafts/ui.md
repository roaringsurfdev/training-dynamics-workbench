REQ_??? - Summary Lens

When I'm looking at a model for the first time, these are the summary visualizations I most want to see first. Some are currently missing, but I'm listing them hear for symmetry as I expect they'd be just as useful.

For Embedding/Unembedding, I'm thinking it might be useful to see these side-by-side in two columns and two rows.

Neuron Frequency Specialization By Epoch and Attention Head Specialization By Epoch might also nicely line up across a row, thought they're not a 50/50 split. Neuron Frequency Specialization is wide and tall, Attention Head Specialization is narrow and tall.

Of the Parameter Trajectory plots, 3D Scatter is the one I want to see first.
