# Hypotheses: [BUG_NNN]

## Instructions

- List possible causes of the bug (aim for 1-5 hypotheses)
- For each hypothesis, predict what evidence you would find if it were correct
- Add new hypotheses to the END of this list as they arise (append-only, no reordering)
- Test hypotheses in order of efficiency (documented in evidence_search.md), not list order

## Hypothesis 1: [Short name/description]

**Theory:**
[Explain what you think might be causing the bug]

**Predicted Evidence:**
[What would you expect to find in the code if this theory is correct?]
- Look for: [specific code patterns, variable states, etc.]
- Location: [where in the codebase to look]
- Expected finding: [what you'd see]

**Why this hypothesis:**
[What makes you think this might be the cause?]

## Hypothesis 2: [Short name/description]

**Theory:**
[Explain what you think might be causing the bug]

**Predicted Evidence:**
[What would you expect to find in the code if this theory is correct?]
- Look for: [specific code patterns, variable states, etc.]
- Location: [where in the codebase to look]
- Expected finding: [what you'd see]

**Why this hypothesis:**
[What makes you think this might be the cause?]
