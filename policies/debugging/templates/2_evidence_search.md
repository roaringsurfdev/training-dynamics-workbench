# Evidence Search: [BUG_NNN]

## Instructions

- Test hypotheses one at a time
- Choose which hypothesis to test based on efficiency (quick validation, low complexity)
- Document testing order and rationale
- Record what you searched for vs what you actually found
- Mark each hypothesis: Validated / Invalidated / Inconclusive

---

## Testing Order

**Plan:**
1. Hypothesis [N] - [Reason for testing first: quick to validate, most likely, etc.]
2. Hypothesis [N] - [Reason for testing second]
3. [etc.]

---

## Hypothesis [N]: [Name]

**Date tested:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Why testing this one:** [Quick to validate / Most likely / etc.]

**Searched:**
- Files examined: [list files]
- Code sections: [specific functions, classes, modules]
- Tools used: [debugger, logs, print statements, etc.]

**Expected to find:**
[What predicted evidence from hypothesis document]

**Actually found:**
[What you actually discovered - be specific]

**Conclusion:** [Validated / Invalidated / Inconclusive]

**Reasoning:**
[Why did you reach this conclusion? How does the evidence support/contradict the hypothesis?]

## Evidence X (Unexpected Findings)

[Document any unexpected evidence found that doesn't match current hypotheses]

**Finding:** [What you discovered]

**Location:** [Where in the code]

**Does this explain the bug symptoms?** [Yes / No / Maybe]

**Action taken:**
- [ ] Added as new hypothesis
- [ ] Logged in discovered_issues.md as separate bug
- [ ] Noted for future investigation
- [ ] Other: [describe]

---

## Summary

**Validated hypothesis:** [Number and name, or "None yet"]

**Next steps:**
[Proceed to fix plan / Test more hypotheses / Consult / etc.]

## Notes

[Any observations, patterns, or insights from the search process]
