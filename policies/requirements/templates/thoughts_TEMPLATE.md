# Claude's Thoughts & Observations

This is an unstructured parking lot for ideas, observations, and suggestions that arise during work. No specific format required - just timestamped notes for asynchronous review.

[Observations, ideas, suggestions - whatever comes up during work]

## Guidelines for Use

**This file is for:**
- Non-blocking observations that might be valuable
- Alternative approaches worth considering
- Potential improvements or refactoring ideas
- Random insights that don't fit elsewhere

**When to use this vs. interrupting:**
- **Interrupt:** Blocking issues, requirement conflicts, need clarification to proceed
- **Log here:** Everything else that's worth capturing but not urgent

**Format:**
- Keep it simple - timestamp and thoughts
- No need for structure or justification
- Can reference specific requirements (REQ_NNN) or just general observations
