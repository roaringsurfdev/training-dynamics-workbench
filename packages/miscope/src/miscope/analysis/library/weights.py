"""Weight matrix extraction utilities.

Provides functions for extracting and analyzing model weight matrices
across training checkpoints. Used by parameter trajectory and
effective dimensionality analyzers.

REQ_114 migration
-----------------
``extract_parameter_snapshot`` and ``compute_weight_singular_values``
now take a :class:`miscope.architectures.HookedModel` and read weights
via canonical names internally. The returned dict still uses legacy
short names (``W_E``, ``W_in``, ...) so downstream consumers (snapshot
artifact schema, ``extract_neuron_weight_matrix`` dispatch logic) are
unchanged.
